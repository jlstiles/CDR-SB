\title{Mixed-effects Repeated Measures Simulations for Alzheimer's Patients}

\section{Introduction}
We aim to simulate data for Alzheimer's Disease patients with a baseline Mini Mental State Exam score of between 24 and 30, which translates to patients with a CDR-SB score of approximately between 0 and 4 \parencite{mmsetocdrsb}.  The patients will be followed for 6 quarterly time periods.  The exact functional dependence of CDR-SB rate of increase per year on various patient characteristics and treatmet is not known, though we have literature available to us that estimates the magnitude of various risk factors on CDR-SB rate in terms of inear model fits.  Having an estimate of coefficients of risk factors and treatment interacting with time in a linear model does not provide an accurate measure of how such coefficients (considered random effects) vary from person to person. For such, it would be beneficial to have actual data and even with data, we do not know the variation of treatment effect on the CDR-SB rate from person to person.\\  

We will thus form two models, one with half the variance in the individual risk factors affecting CDR-SB rate.  For each of these two basic models, we will include a censoring mechanism that is informed by CDR-SB, according to the literature.  We will also run each simulation where 25\% of the study does not have any information past 1 year (4 quarterly time periods) as an interim analysis might occur during a randomized clinical trial.  The goal in our simulations is to capture natural variation of outcomes one might see in the population. The following is our general procedure, which is repeated 5000 times for each type of simulation.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Generate the data randomly (monte carlo draws from known distributions) with the true treatment effect incorporated into the population model, along with various other known factors from the literature.   
\item
Perform an estimator aimed at asceratining marginal effects of the treatment. In our case, we will perform a generalized estimating equation (GEE) estimator and a mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) estimator with some additional main terms interacting with time as well as a basic model.  
\item
If the estimate of the decrease in CDR-SB growth rate from treatment is significant (at signficance level 0.05) then we will have shown a significant marginal effect of treatment and we will not have committed type II error.    
\end{enumerate}

Then we compute the percentage of type II errors made for our power computation. The rest of the this report details the steps above and then gives the results of the simulations.

Ostrowitzki et al., 2017 \nocite{gantenerumab}.

This study detailed a phase III clinical trial with a study population very much similar to our interests in terms of the 797 participants having a mean MMSE score of 25.7 and a mean baseline CDR-SB score of 2.1.  The paper also provided a percentage breakdown for APOE4 genotypes, 29.7\% had not the allele, 50.4\% had heterozygous allele and 19.9\% had the homozygous allele. The APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E which combines with lipids in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. The plaque build-up in the brain of alzheimer's patients is thought to be related to the APOE4 allele.  The average CDR-SB growth rate per year was roughly 1.60, which was very similar for placebo and control in this trial, and the mean age of the population was 69.5.

Haaksma et al., 2018 \nocite{study1100}:

Gender: females have a faster rate, as also referenced by Lin et al., 2015. \nocite{menwomen, study1100}.  This study had a sample size of 1120 of alzheimer's patients from 31 different locations.  They were able to distinguish three different classes of patients in terms of progression rate but here we are mainly concerned with modeling the control arm.  mean cdr-sb decline about 1.2 to 1.4 over 3 years and the baseline CDR-SB was 3.8, baseline MMSE 24.2 with an average age of 79.4.  The study also found an association between those with previous hypertension as a protective and those with higher education as a risk factor.  The reason for the higher education being a risk factor could be due to the fact more educated people score better on the tests and are therefore diagnosed later in the disease progression.  We can see in the figure below, that some of the rates of CDR-SB decrease were quite rapid, a very broad range. In the figure below, CDR-SB was inverted so that decrease means getting worse.  The CDR-SB control arm progression rate is not a linear function of time as evidenced by figure below.

This study was a phase 1b interim analysis for aducanumab.  There were only 40 observed in the placebo group for a year.  Their baseline CDR-SB and MMSE were 2.66 and 24.7, respectively and the CDR-SB rate was about 1.6 per year.

This is a report from a collaboration of Eisai and Biogen to develop the drug, BAN2401.  They had 245 placebo (43 cens) 609 (137 cens) treated.  The mean MMSE bl 25.6 $\pm 2.4$  and CDR-SB bl 2.95 $\pm1.37$.  Mean age was 71.4 and 71.1 (treated) with a range of 50-90 and 50-89 (treated).  In this population, 71.2\% had the allele APOE4.  
The placebo CDR-SB increase was 1.5 in 18 months.  

\item
Haeberlein et al., 2017:

This was review of the clinical development of aducanumab. They had 48 placebo participants with an MMSE average at baseline of 24.7 $\pm 3.6$, CDR-SB bl 2.69 $\pm1.54$,  APOE4+ 34/48\%, Mean Age = 73.8 $\pm 6.8$.  The placebo group declined 2 in 54 weeks, which was on the high end of estimates.

Many baseline factors can predict the risk of rapid AD progression, including young age, male gender (though female has been associated with more rapid decline), deteriorated cognition, behavioral symptoms, poor awareness of impairment, impaired activities of daily living, and delirium \parencite{alzCERAD}. The final ALSOVA study group was comprised of 236 persons with very mild (CDR = 0.5, n = 128) or mild AD (CDR = 1.0, n = 108) at baseline.

We will start with a basic model: start with model $Y_{i,t} = \beta_{0,i} + \alpha_{i,t} t + \epsilon_{i,t}$.  One could start by making the rate dependent on the baseline CDR-SB score. 

The following code chunk shows the parameters of the data generating systems used for the simulations.  We envision a trial lasting 18 months with quarterly measurements of the participants. 

\section{The Parameter of Interest}
When one says there is 25\% decrease in the yearly rate of CDR-SB score one is perhaps envisioning that at each time point, $t$, there is an average outcome for the counterfactual population of interest under treatment, $a$.  A random outcome at time, $t$, under such a counterfactual world is denoted, $Y_a(t)$, as per the Neyman-Rubin causal model \parencite{Rubin1974}. The mean outcome of such a counterfactual population is denoted $E[Y_a(t) \mid  ]$.  If we were to plot, $E[Y_a(t) \mid  A = a]$, then the result would not be a line as such is one function out of infinitely many possibilities.  Therefore when we talk of yearly rate of CDR-SB increase, we are talking about the slope of the nearest line, as measured by least-squares, to the function, $f_a(t) = E[Y_a(t) \mid  A = a]$. Such is depicted below, as a hypothetical example, where $t$ represents quarterly increments. We can see the control arm in this hypothetical example had a faster overall linear marginal rate over the 6 time periods but not during all the intervals since the true marginal curves had different forms.

f_1 = c(1.3, 1.6,2,2.7,2.9,3.1,3.2)
f_0 = c(1.3, 1.45,1.75, 2, 2.9, 3.6, 4)

If I heavily weighted the first three time points, then we would have as depicted below.  Notice how the weighted projections of the true curves differed, showing very little affect of treatment as far as the slope of the lines. This shows that linear projections of the true curves changes due to weighting of the points. The only time weighting would not matter is if the true curves themselves were lines, in which case the projections would just give back the curves themselves.  \\

\subsection{Mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM)}
In our case, we model CDR-SB response over time as follows:
\[
y_i(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_a At + b_{0,i} + b_{1,i} t + \epsilon_i
\]

where $y_i(t)$ is the CDR-SB score at time, $t$, and $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_a $are considered fixed and $b_{0,i}, b_{1,i}$ are random effects on the individual level.  For a randomized trial where censoring is not informed by the past and completely at random, the estimate for $\beta_a$ will give the true rate increase under treatment (negative for helpful in this case) as described above if it estimates the covariance matrix of within individual CDR-SB scores correctly.  However, MMRM models this covariance matrix based on normally distributed errors with a certain covariance structure, which thusly, weights the projection as described above as shown in Wakefield, 2012, chapter 8 \nocite{wakefield}. 

\subsubsection{Informative censoring}
In the literature on alzheimer's there is drop-out (right censoring) in randomized trials. As discussed, we found that censoring chances are increased with a higher CDR-SB score, which means censoring is informed by past variables. Our parameter of interest is the increase due to treatment of the yearly rate in a counterfactual population without censoring.  This holds a problem for the industry in that such a counterfactual is not truly reflective of reality.  In reality we have a competing risk of being censored or dying from other causes, which is a considerable factor for an elderly population.  In a counterfactual world, one cannot enforce those ready to die of other causes to keep living and such would not even be of interest, arguably, for ascertaining the relevant effects of a medication. However, setting this issue aside, censoring which is informed by the past is a form of confounding of the sample that could attenuate estimates of the effect of treatment if such effects are helpful.  In our case, those who did not receive treatment would suffer higher CDR-SB scores and, therefore, leave the study in higher proportions than those who received treatment and, therefore, had lower CDR-SB scores.  This would skew estimates of $\beta_a$ toward the null hypothesis of no effect.\\

It is important to note that MMRM does not account for informative censoring and neither does a generalized estimating equation approach (robins).  Thus we recommend such statistical analysis be done with an inverse weighted procedure as in (robins) or even more efficient is the TMLE procedure of Mark van der Laan.  Employing these estimators in a simulation is beyond the scope of this report but it is well-known they will outperform (in terms of mean squared error from the true parameter) parametric approaches such as GEE and MMRM when confounding is present. 

\section{Simulation}
We will simulate the data according to the following system.  

\item 
Draw the patient characteristics:

gender and being hypertensive are assumed binary distributions with probability of 0.5.  
The APOE4 allele is .4 for none, .4 chance to be heterozygous and .2 chance of being homozygous (following the literature).  Education is random normal with a mean of 15 years and standard deviation of 4 (following the literature).  Age is random normal with mean of 70 and standard deviation of 7.5 and hippocampus volume has a mean of 3000 with a standard deviation of 370 (following the literature).  For each simulated patient we draw these covariates

\item
assign treatment with probability 0.5 as per a randomized trial

\item
Those who are female receive a random rate of increase according to a normal, mean = .24, sd = .8.  
Those who are female hypertensive receive a random rate of decrease according to a normal, mean = .26, sd = .8.  
Those have no APOE4 allele receive on average a -0.04 decrease in rate and those who are heterozygous receive a 00.12 increase in rate and those who are homozygous receive a 0.28 increase in rate. Participants receive on average a 0.12 increase in rate per standard deviation, according to a beta distribution. Participants receive a .04 increase in rate per standard deviation in age and a decrease of 0.04 for every standard deviation of hippocampus volume.  These parameters follow the literature in terms of the direction of the effect.

\item
correlation within individual outcomes over time:

We add random normal noise on each individual's slope, which is multivariate normal, autoregressive (as discussed in Wakefield, 2012 for longitudinal data) with $\rho = 0.5$ and standard deviation at each time point of 0.8.  

\item 

Fixed Effects are a yearly rate of 1.33 CDR-SB points per year, linear by design, though, as discussed, this will likely not be the case.  However, in the absence of knowledge on the functional form, it is unadvisable to assume any one in particular and so we opt for linearity and test power based on variation in factors affecting the rate.
We impose an intercept (average baseline CDR-SB value) of 2.5 as per the literature for those with MMSE score of 26.  We also impose a decrease in the rate of 25\% and 15\% and perform simulations for each along with an interim analysis where only 75\% of the patients were observed for more than a year.   

\item 
We also impose a random effect on the baseline rate of increase which is beta(2,3) distribution times 4/1.2, which has a standard deviation of 0.65 points per year and never negative as no one is assumed to be getting better at the test other than via random test fluctuation in scores. A random affect on the treatment effect is beta(3,5)(-2) distributed with a standard deviation of 0.08, so the majority receive a benefit from treatment but not all. 

\item
We follow the literature in imposing a censoring mechansim where the hazard of being censored at each time point is a function of $Y_t$, the CDR-SB score at the previous time point, $exp(-3 + .189*Y_t)$. This ends up censoring roughly 10 to 15 \% of the participants, which seems to be reasonable for an alzheimer's trial.

\section{The estimation procedure}
We aim to estimate the marginal effects of treatment as an average rate of change in CDR-SB per year for the population under treatment.  Before we explain the methodology we define the following notation:
$Y_1(t)$ is the counterfactual outcome (\parencite{neyman1923}) of a random individual in the population under treatment at time, $t$, and $Y_0(t)$ is the counterfactual outcome of a random individual in the population under placebo at time, $t$.  For the population in reality, we wish to know the function of time, $t$: $f_1(t) = \mathbb{E} Y_1(t)$ and $f_0(t) = \mathbb{E} Y_0(t)$ and then make a comparison. However, we do not know the functional form of $f_0$ or $f_1$.  Thus, our estimate for the $\beta_a$ will be the slope of the line estimating $f_1$ minus the slope of line estimating $f_0$.  Below we illustrate the parameter we are estimating for the population.\\

To estimate the parameter described above, it is common to use either the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach or a mixed effects repeated measures (MMRM) approach. Here we will focus on MMRM.  The true functions may be close to linear but there is no chance they are identically linear. If censoring is informed by the past as well as time varying variables, such as the outcome, for instance, then MMRM will give biased estimates due to confounding by censoring. If, for instance, patients who benefit in CDR-SB from treatment quit due to minor side effects, the censoring will bias toward the null hypothesis of no treatment effect.  If treatment causes some negative effects on CDR-SB and thus causes doctors to censor the patient, then bias will go away from the null hypothesis. The case to be very wary of for this kind of trial would be censoring due to higher CDR-SB.  If the treatment is working well and those with high CDR-SB in the placebo group are censored, then not accounting for the mechanism behind the censoring will attentuate the good effects of the treatment.  The GEE approach will have similar problems unless we use inverse weighting by probability of censoring \parencite{Robins:2000aa}. However, this approach is most likely lacking in efficiency (cite petersen). \\ 


Therefore, it is recommended, though beyond the scope of this report, that the statistics are performed in a way that estimates the parameter of interest in an unbiased way via the use of a marginal structural model estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation \parencite{Laan:2006aa, Laan:2011aa}.\\ 


Though in reality, the true functional form of 
Here is an example of one draw used in the simulation. First we check the true values by generating a large sample (population) of 1 million participants and get the true parameter values.
<<echo = echo, eval = FALSE>>==
# get truth
pop = sim_CDR(n=1e5, time, G, W_ind = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), effect_ind = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 
              vars, effects, random_effects)
head(pop)
time
Y0 = unlist(lapply(time, FUN = function(x) mean(pop[pop$A == 0 & pop$t==x, "Y_t"])))
Y1 = unlist(lapply(time, FUN = function(x) mean(pop[pop$A == 1 & pop$t==x, "Y_t"])))
plot(time, Y0)
plot(time, Y1)

((Y0[7] - Y0[1])/6)
((Y0[7] - Y0[1])/6 - (Y1[7] - Y1[1])/6)/((Y0[7] - Y0[1])/6)

Then we illustrate drawing a sample from this population and performing the simulation estimators
<<echo = echo, eval = FALSE>>==
n=1600
# undebug(sim_CDR)
df_alz = sim_CDR(n, time, G, W_ind = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), effect_ind = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 
                 vars, effects, main_effects)


head(df_alz,6)

# with every 1 increase in CDR-SB, 20% higher chance of censoring so we have cox model: following the table we
# have prob of censoring is about exp(-3 + .189*CDR-SB)

# library(plyr)
df_alz1 = ddply(df_alz, "ID", .fun = function(x) {
  
  probs = exp(-3 + .189*x$Y_t)[1:(length(time)-1)]
  cens = rbinom((length(time)-1), 1, probs)
  if (any(cens==1)) {
    C = min(which(cens==1))+1
    return(x[1:C,])
  } else return(x)
})
  
head(df_alz1, 20)
# nrow(df_alz)
# run a random effects model, ignoring patient characteristics under RCT
# test_alz <- lmer(Y_t ~ A:t +  t + (t | ID) + W1:t + W2:t + V3:t + V4:t+W4:t, df_alz)
# test_alz <- lmer(Y_t ~ A:t +  t +  W1 + W2 + V3 + V4 + (t | ID), df_alz)
# test_alz <- lmer(Y_t ~ A:t +  t + t:W1 + t:W2 + (t | ID),data= df_alz)
test_alz <- lmer(Y_t ~ A:t +  t + (t | ID),data= df_alz)
test_alz1 <- lmer(Y_t ~ A:t +  t + (t | ID),data= df_alz1)
ss = summary(test_alz)
ss1 = summary(test_alz1)

We can visualize what this sample looks like by looking at the predicted slopes of the CDR-SB progression.

preds = predict(test_alz)
plot(preds[df_alz$ID==1], 0:(length(preds[df_alz$ID==1])-1))

range = 1:200
plotdf = data.frame(y = preds[df_alz$ID %in% range],
                    x = df_alz$t[df_alz$ID %in% range],
                    ID = df_alz$ID[df_alz$ID %in% range])


library(ggplot2)
plotdf$ID = as.factor(plotdf$ID)
ggover = ggplot() + geom_line(data = subset(plotdf, ID ==1), aes(x = x, y=y))+geom_line(color = "blue")
ggover + geom_line(data = subset(plotdf, ID == 4), aes(x = x, y=y))+geom_line(color = "blue")
for (i in 2:200) {
  ggover = ggover + geom_line(data = subset(plotdf, ID ==i), aes(x = x, y = y), color = "blue")
